## Getting started
1. Once you are done with the changes you should be able to execute the todo app by running the following command from the terminal.

   **On Windows:**

   ```
   .\todo.bat
   ```

   **On \*nix:**

   ```
   ./todo.sh
   ```
## Run Automated Tests

### 1. Install Node.js

You need to have npm installed in your computer for this problem. It comes with Node.js and you can get it by installing Node from https://nodejs.org/en/

### 2. Install dependencies

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### 3. Create Create symbolic link to the executable file

#### On Windows

To create a symbolic link on Windows, you'll need to run either the Windows Command Prompt, or Windows Powershell **with administrator privileges**. To do so, right-click on the icon for Command Prompt, or Powershell, and choose the _"Run as Administrator"_ option.

**Command Prompt:**

```
> mklink todo todo.bat
```

**Powershell:**

```
> cmd /c mklink todo todo.bat
```

#### On \*nix:

Run the following command in your shell:

```
$ ln -s todo.sh todo
```

## A Note about `/` for Windows Users

In the following sections, you'll see many commands prefixed with `./`, or paths containing the `/` (forward-slash) character.

If you're using the Windows _Command Prompt_, then you'll need to replace `/` with `\` (back-slash) for these commands and paths to work as expected.

On Windows _Powershell_, these substitutions are not required.


## Usage

### 1. Help

Executing the command without any arguments, or with a single argument `help` prints the CLI usage.

```
$ ./todo help
Usage :-
$ ./todo add "todo item"  # Add a new todo
